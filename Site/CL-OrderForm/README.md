This is an order form for a company I freelance for.  They have 
requested a mobile friendly ordering system that can eventually
have the ability to tie into their CRM RESTful API.

This was actually a semi-complicated Javascript script to create.  
This company has a lot of service options and do not want to give 
too many options to the client.  So as you pick additional options, 
the navigation will update for you.  

Additionally they wanted the final results to convert to a PDF.  I am
currently trying to do this with a Node script but I may instead use a
simply Python script to make it a little easier.

This was added to test continuous integration.
